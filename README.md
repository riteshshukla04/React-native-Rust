# React Native Turbo Modules with Rust

This is an experimental project exploring the integration of Rust-based Turbo Modules in React Native.

### Current Progress
- Got Rust integration working, but with some limitations


## Issue
I am not super happy the way this works. I imagined bridging through  100% cpp but was not able to do through cpp due to turbo modules enforcing errors. Had to bridge through java.
